# odin-recipes-project
This is the first project in the Odin Project html lesson path - I have to create a Recipe webpage. The hope is that I will use this to marry up all of my current learnings into one conjusive place - enabling me to reflect and evaluate what I've done over the last couple of days.
It's going to be exciting, I feel my brain is far more inquisitive and I feel ready to take on the wonderful world of web development.
